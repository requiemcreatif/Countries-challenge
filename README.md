# Countries Challenge

## Personal Note

I developed this application with a focus on creating a solid foundation that could easily scale to a larger project. While the requirements were straightforward, I deliberately chose technologies and implemented a structure that would support future growth and complexity.

I selected Next.js, Apollo Client, and TypeScript as the core technologies because they provide excellent developer experience while maintaining high performance and type safety. The modular component design, dedicated GraphQL query files, and extensive test coverage demonstrate how even a seemingly simple application can be built with enterprise-grade practices.

The project structure separates concerns into distinct folders (components, providers, graphql, types), making it maintainable and extendable. My implementation choices, such as the tooltip functionality, theme toggling, and responsive design, to provide a bit more details and focus on user experience instead of just meeting basic requirements.

This application is more than just a coding challengeâ€”it's a demonstration of how I approach software development with scalability and quality in mind from the start.

I hope you like it. Please feel free to provide some feedback.

Thanks.

## Overview

This project consumes the GraphQL API available at https://countries.trevorblades.com/ to display the list of countries. Users can filter countries by code as required, also view detailed information with the tooltips, navigate through paginated results, and toggle between light and dark themes.
